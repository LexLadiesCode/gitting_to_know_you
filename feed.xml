    <title>♬ (Git)ting to know you, getting to know all about Git! ♬</title>
    <description>This event will consist of a presentation and workshop geared towards those who want to be effective using Git and Github to collaborate on community projects. No programming skills required! The topics discussed will apply to many use cases such as: organizing projects, collaborating on documents, and just boring old code stuff.
After a presentation covering core concepts, participants will use their choice of tools (command-line, GUI, or just Github) to practice basic work-flows that are used to contribute to projects.
